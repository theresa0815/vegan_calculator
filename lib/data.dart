Almost 50% of grain worldwide is given to livestock and about 80% of soy.    
There are quite different numbers on how much compound feed (often mainly soy and grain) is needed to produce 1 kg of beef. But in fact, the animals need a lot of energy simply to live (move if possible, keeping a certain body temperature...). In a way, this is the energy we lose when feeding cows instead of humans.

About 18% of greenhouse gas emissions occur in animal agriculture, which is more than the emissions from the transportation sector -especially because of cows producing about 150 billion gallons of methane each day globally. Taking into account, that more than 40% of earth's land is covered with livestock, (which could be given back to its natural habitat (such as the rainforest)) we could save up to 65% of all human greenhouse gas emissions with a mainly plant-based lifestyle!

According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), more than 2 in 3 adults are overweight or have obesity. 
Approximately 350 million people suffer under diabetes worldwide, still each day with one serving of processed meat highers the risk of developing type-2 diabetes by 51%.   Furthermore a vegan diet confers high protection against cardiovascular diseases, obesity, hypertension as well as some cancers (exp.: dairy is responsible for about 34% higher risk for men to get prostate cancer; only 5-10% of cancer is genetic).
